# Wallet-Application

**Phase 1**- Only backend with Collection: No error

**Phase 2**- Backend with jpa and Oracle: 100% completed,  Error loading in the database due to some dependency issue

**Phase 3**- Backend with spring boot: 50% completed, No Error
                     Frontend with angular: nearly 50% completed, error due to no connection to Spring Boot

**Things left to do**:
- Debug errors in Phase two
- Create the main class in phase 3 and debug errors, if any
- Connect angular to spring(service class has been created but all methods are not written in it)  and debug errors
- Make Junit test cases for spring boot application
- Add comments in the entire project
